Nearest Neighbors in Astronomy
==============================
This example demonstrates the use of both k-d tree-based
implementations on a large-scale astronomical data set that is 
based on the Sloan Digitial Sky Survey (http://www.sdss.org). 
The data set contains 2,000,000 training points and 10,000,000
test points in a 10-dimensional feature space.
Note: The platform and the device needs to be specified below 
(via the parameter 'plat_dev_ids').
